# ASReview - Quick Start (What You Actually Need to Do)

## ✅ What You MUST Do (Required)

### 1. Upload Your CSV File
- Click "Add Data" or "Import"
- Select `data/asreview_export.csv`
- Map fields: title → `title`, abstract → `abstract`, identifier → `pmid`
- Click "Next"

### 2. Start Screening
- Click "Start Reviewing" or "Begin Screening"
- Articles appear one at a time
- For each article, click:
  - **✅ Relevant** (or press `1`) - If it's about knee OA prediction/progression
  - **❌ Irrelevant** (or press `0`) - If it's not relevant

**That's it!** Everything else is optional.

## ⚙️ Optional Settings (You Can Skip These)

### "Labeling Tags" - **SKIP THIS**
- This is for organizing articles into categories
- **Not required** for basic screening
- You can add tags later if you want
- **Just click "Next" or "Skip"**

### "Select Model" (AI) - **USE DEFAULT**
- ASReview will suggest a default AI model
- **Just use the default** - it works great
- No need to change anything
- **Click "Next" or "Start"**

### "Prior Knowledge" - **OPTIONAL**
- This is to "warm up" the AI with a few examples
- **You can skip this** - the AI will learn as you go
- **OR** quickly label 5-10 articles as examples:
  - Find 2-3 relevant articles → Mark ✅ Relevant
  - Find 2-3 irrelevant articles → Mark ❌ Irrelevant
  - Then click "Start Reviewing"
- **Either way works!**

## 🎯 Recommended: Quick Prior Knowledge (5 minutes)

**Why do this?**
- Helps AI prioritize better articles first
- Saves you time overall

**How:**
1. In "Prior Knowledge" section
2. **Search** for a relevant article (e.g., type "knee osteoarthritis prediction")
3. Mark 2-3 as ✅ **Relevant**
4. Mark 2-3 as ❌ **Irrelevant** (e.g., hip OA, unrelated topics)
5. Click "Start Reviewing"

**OR just skip it** - AI will learn as you screen!

## 📋 What Happens During Screening

### The Process:
1. **Article appears** with title and abstract
2. **You decide**: Relevant or Irrelevant?
3. **Click button** (✅ or ❌)
4. **Next article appears automatically**
5. **AI learns** from your decisions
6. **AI shows better articles first** (most relevant appear earlier)

### You DON'T Need To:
- ❌ Approve each article individually
- ❌ Review settings for each article
- ❌ Do anything special
- ❌ Just label: Relevant or Irrelevant

### You DO Need To:
- ✅ Label each article: Relevant or Irrelevant
- ✅ That's it!

### Quick Decision Guide:
**✅ Relevant** if article mentions:
- Knee osteoarthritis progression
- Total knee replacement prediction
- TKR/TKA prediction models
- Knee OA risk factors
- Prognostic factors for knee OA

**❌ Irrelevant** if article is about:
- Hip OA (not knee)
- Other joints
- Treatment only (not prediction)
- Not related to knee OA
