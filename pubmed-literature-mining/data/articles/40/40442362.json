  "title": "Early intervention in knee osteoarthritis with genicular artery embolization is associated with improved clinical outcomes.",
  "abstract": "Genicular artery embolization (GAE) is an emerging, minimally invasive treatment option for knee OA (osteoarthritis). The purpose of this study was to analyze factors associated with clinical success in GAE. This IRB-approved, retrospective, single-center study analyzed 236 patients who underwent GAE for knee OA between May 2018 and September 2022. Clinical, radiographic, and technical variables were analyzed for association with clinical outcomes in GAE. The primary endpoint was clinical success assessed at one year. Overall clinical success was reported in 128 patients (54.2%). Clinical success was observed in younger patients (67.5 ± 9.4 vs 71.5 ± 11.1 years, p < 0.01) with higher BMI (29.7 ± 5.3 vs 27.6 ± 6.4 kg/m GAE is an effective procedure with durable clinical improvement at one year, particularly in younger patients and those with mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis. These findings suggest that early intervention with GAE may be appropriate in patients who are not candidates for, or do not desire, total knee arthroplasty. Question GAE is a minimally invasive intervention for knee osteoarthritis, however, there is a paucity of evidence describing factors associated with improved clinical outcomes. Findings Factors associated with clinical success in GAE included younger patients and those with early-stage osteoarthritis. Clinical relevance These findings support GAE as an early intervention for patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.",
