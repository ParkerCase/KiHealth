  "title": "A Machine Learning Method to Determine Candidates for Total and Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Based on a Voting Mechanism.",
  "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent condition. Accurate selection between total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is crucial for optimal treatment in patients who have end-stage KOA, particularly for improving clinical outcomes and reducing health care costs. This study proposes a machine learning model based on a voting mechanism to enhance the accuracy of surgical decision-making for KOA patients. Radiographic data were collected from a high-volume joint arthroplasty practice, focusing on anterior-posterior, lateral, and skyline X-ray views. The dataset included 277 TKA and 293 UKA cases, each labeled through intraoperative observations (indicating whether TKA or UKA was the appropriate choice). A five-fold cross-validation approach was used for training and validation. In the proposed method, three base models were first trained independently on single-view images, and a voting mechanism was implemented to aggregate model outputs. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by using metrics such as accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 94.2% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98%, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing models. The voting mechanism enabled base models to effectively utilize the detailed features from all three X-ray views, leading to enhanced predictive accuracy and model interpretability. This study provides a high-accuracy method for surgical decision-making between TKA and UKA for KOA patients, requiring only standard X-rays and offering potential for clinical application in automated referrals and preoperative planning.",
