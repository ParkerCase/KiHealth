  "title": "Ultrasound therapy inhibits knee osteoarthritis progression in rabbits by activating the PPARs pathway: a pilot study.",
  "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) is effective in knee osteoarthritis (KOA), but its therapeutic mechanism is unclear, particularly the interaction between US and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). This study aims to elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of US through PPARs signaling. A surgically induced KOA rabbit model evaluated the therapeutic effects of Sham US, US, Fenofibrate (PPAR-α agonist), and Rosiglitazone (PPAR-γ agonist) via MRI. Cartilage and synovium tissues were collected for immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and western blotting. Synovial fluid inflammatory factors were analyzed. We also developed an  MRI revealed that US therapy slowed cartilage thinning and improved cartilage structure in the KOA model. Concurrently, US therapy effectively reduced chondrocyte damage and degradation  Our results show that US therapy could arrest the progression of KOA by reducing synovial inflammation, delaying cartilage degradation, and decreasing extracellular matrix degradation ",
