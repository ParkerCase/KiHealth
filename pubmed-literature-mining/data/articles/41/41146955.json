  "title": "Changes in knee pain and walking speed following primary, unilateral total knee arthroplasty and their association: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "To quantify changes in knee pain and walking speed following primary, unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for knee osteoarthritis, and to examine their relationship during recovery. Walking speed is a key indicator of functional recovery and long-term health, but whether pain relief translates into improved mobility remains unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. PubMed was searched to September 2025 for studies reporting pre- and post-TKA values of knee pain (WOMAC-pain or KOOS-pain) and self-selected walking speed in adults undergoing primary, unilateral TKA. Pooled changes were calculated using inverse-variance weighted random-effects models. Meta-regression explored associations between pain and walking speed, adjusting for covariates. Eighteen studies (n ​= ​819; 64.1 ​% female; age 65.1 ​± ​8.3 years; body mass index 28.4 ​± ​5.9 ​kg/m TKA yields substantial pain relief and improved walking speeds by 3-12 months. However, mobility gains are not sustained beyond one year and are influenced by pain. Postoperative care should support both symptoms and mobility to improve long-term outcomes.",
