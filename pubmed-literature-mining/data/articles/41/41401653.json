  "title": "Correlation of sit-to-walk and sit-to-stand performance with gait kinematic outcomes and self-reported pain and function in end-stage knee osteoarthritis.",
  "abstract": "Sit-to-Walk (STW), 30-second Sit-to-Stand (30 s-STS), gait kinematic outcomes, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are used to assess pain and functionality in knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, their interrelationships in end-stage OA are unclear. This study investigates correlations between STW and 30 s-STS performance, gait kinematic outcomes, and PROMs in individuals with end-stage knee OA. Eleven participants (8 females, 3 males) with end-stage knee OA performed walking, STW, and 30 s-STS tests, recorded using a markerless motion capture system in a hospital. Visual3D analysis yielded 30 s-STS repetitions, STW time, knee flexion range of motion (ROM), stride width, and gait speed. Within two weeks, participants completed the EQ-5D-5L, Oxford Knee Score, and Numerical Pain Rating Scale. Pearson and Spearman rank orders were used to determine the correlations between these measures. A significant moderate positive correlation was observed between 30 s-STS and OKS: Function (ρ = 0.68, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.92, p = 0.03, R",
