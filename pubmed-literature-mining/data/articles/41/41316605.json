  "title": "Impact of home-based exercise and clinic-based physiotherapy on mobility status of patients undergoing total knee replacement: A randomized clinical trial.",
  "abstract": "Total knee replacement (TKR) is a common intervention for knee osteoarthritis; however, the most effective post-surgical rehabilitation strategy remains uncertain. This study aimed to compare the effects of home-based exercise versus clinic-based physiotherapy on functional mobility in patients following TKR. A single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 80 TKR patients. Participants were randomly assigned to either a home-based exercise group (n = 40) or a clinic-based physiotherapy group (n = 40). Both groups followed structured, four-week rehabilitation protocols. Functional mobility was assessed pre- and post-intervention using the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale. Both groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements in functional mobility after the intervention (p < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed between the two rehabilitation approaches (p = 0.078). These findings suggest that home-based rehabilitation is as effective as clinic-based physiotherapy for enhancing mobility after TKR. The structure of the rehabilitation program and patient adherence may play a more critical role than the setting in determining outcomes. IRCT20230928059543N3, July 25, 2024.",
