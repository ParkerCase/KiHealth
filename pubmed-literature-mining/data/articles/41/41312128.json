  "title": "Avoiding Orthostatic Intolerance During Early Ambulation After Total Knee Arthroplasty: The Impact of Lying-to-Standing Time.",
  "abstract": "Orthostatic intolerance (OI), characterized by dizziness, blurred vision, syncope, can occur during ambulation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) causing delayed rehabilitation and hospital discharge. Standardized guidelines to prevent OI during early ambulation are lacking. This study aimed to provide evidence regarding the impact of postural transition timing or lying-to-standing time (LTST) on OI during early postoperative ambulation following TKA. We evaluated 120 patients undergoing unilateral primary TKA for OI with varying LTST. Patients with significant comorbidities, body mass index ≥40 kg/m From 120 TKAs, 98 patients were included (mean age 74 years, mean body mass index 26.46 kg/m This study demonstrates that a 60-second sitting interval between lying and standing effectively prevents OI during early ambulation after TKA.",
