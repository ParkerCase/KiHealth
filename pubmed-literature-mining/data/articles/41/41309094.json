  "abstract": "Value in health care is defined as optimized patient-centered outcomes and streamlined costs of care. A patient-level value analysis (PLVA) is a novel value-based health care research method. In a PLVA, the ratio of outcomes to cost is calculated for each individual patient in a cohort, and factors that optimize value are investigated. We performed a PLVA in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained multi-institutional arthroplasty registry. A total of 2,789 primary manual TKAs were analyzed. Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short-Form (KOOS-PS) scores and costs of care using time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) were collected. All costs were converted from U.S. dollars to arbitrary cost units (CUs) to protect confidential hospital financial data. The primary outcome was the value quotient (Value ",
