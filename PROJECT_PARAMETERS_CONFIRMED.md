### Project Parameters Confirmed

Generated: 2025-10-30

## 1) Client Information

- Client: STARX Therapeutics
- Primary contact: Dr. Taylor
- Other stakeholders: Dr. Spinetti, Eric, Yangbo

## 2) Project Goal

- Goal: Identify cancer indications where multi-target kinase inhibition (STK17A, MYLK4, TBK1, CLK4) is most promising, using DepMap and omics to prioritize contexts and biomarkers.
- Deliverable: Preliminary findings report with top indications and evidence, followed by comprehensive scoring and a dashboard.

## 3) Target Genes

- PRIMARY: STK17A, TBK1, CLK4, MYLK4
- SECONDARY (not yet analyzed): XPO1, BTK (notebooks/schema mention only)
- Current analysis subset: Primary 4 are analyzed in dependency; mutation context analyzed for 4; expression/copy number pending.

## 4) Current Indication

- Clinical focus referenced: AML and others considered in rankings; comparisons to current indication are planned but not yet compiled.

## 5) Deliverable Dates

- Preliminary findings due: November 10, 2025 (from roadmap context)
- Final delivery due: November 16, 2025 (dashboard phase end target)
- Today's date: October 30, 2025
- Days until preliminary: 11
- Days until final: 17

## 6) Roadmap Phase

- Phases:
  - Phase 1: Oct 23-26 (Setup & Learning)
  - Phase 2: Oct 27-30 (Combination Analysis)
  - Phase 3: Oct 31-Nov 4 (Preliminary Report)
  - Phase 4: Nov 6-16 (Dashboard)
- Based on today (Oct 30): SHOULD be in Phase 2 (end of Combination Analysis)
- Actual work: Dependency, rankings, mutation context partially done; expression/copy number pending.

## 7) What’s Actually Been Done vs Roadmap

- Completed: Multi-target dependency analysis; Cancer type rankings; Top dependent cell lines; Mutation context analysis scaffolded; Data infrastructure and Xata readiness.
- In progress: Synthetic lethality results (computed), expression correlation (not fully saved), comprehensive scoring (not integrated), report drafting.
- Status vs roadmap: On-track to slightly ahead on data readiness; execution of Phase 2 analyses is partial; ready to enter Phase 3 on Oct 31.

## Gap Analysis

- Missing: Expression correlation outputs; Copy number analysis; Literature mining links; Comprehensive scoring integration; Comparison to client’s current indication; Slide deck draft.
- Risks: Small n for top cancers; MYLK4 weak dependency; synthetic lethality signals modest.
