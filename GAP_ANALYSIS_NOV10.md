### Gap Analysis for Nov 10 Preliminary Findings

Generated: 2025-10-30 (11 days to Nov 10)

## 1) What We Need for Nov 10

- Top 5-10 cancer indications with scores
- Evidence breakdown (DepMap, literature, mutations, expression; copy number if possible)
- Combination therapy recommendations
- Comparison to current indication
- 20-slide presentation
- Professional PDF report

## 2) What We Have Now

- Cancer type rankings with scores: READY
- Evidence for top cancers (DepMap data): READY
- Evidence for top cancers (literature): MISSING
- Evidence for top cancers (mutations): PARTIAL (synthetic lethality results exist)
- Evidence for top cancers (expression): MISSING
- Combination therapy predictions: MISSING
- Comparison to AML/current indication: MISSING
- Professional figures/visualizations: PARTIAL (3 figures)
- Written report draft: PARTIAL (comprehensive report skeleton present)
- Presentation slides: MISSING

## 3) Critical Path to Nov 10

- Priority 1 (MUST HAVE):
  - Expression-dependency correlation (save CSV + figure)
  - Literature review for top 10 cancers/targets (counts + key citations)
  - Integrate mutation context results into rankings
  - Draft preliminary report (10-12 pages) and 20-slide deck
  - Finalize top 5-10 indications and rationale
- Priority 2 (SHOULD HAVE):
  - Copy number impact and integration
  - Combination therapy hypotheses (rule-based pathway complementarity)
  - Clean, unified comprehensive scoring table
- Priority 3 (NICE TO HAVE):
  - Dashboard stub (static pages)
  - Xata upload of final tables

## 4) Time Allocation (66–88 hours available)

- Completing missing analyses: 24–32 hours
  - Expression correlation: 8–10h
  - Copy number: 8–10h
  - Literature extraction/summaries: 8–12h
- Visualizations: 6–8 hours
- Writing report: 12–16 hours
- Creating presentation: 8–12 hours
- Review/polish: 6–8 hours
- TOTAL: 56–76 hours
- FEASIBILITY: COMFORTABLE (with focus and scope control)

## 5) Recommended Cuts (if over budget)

- Defer combination therapy modeling to high-level qualitative recommendations
- Limit copy number analysis to targets only (not genome-wide)
- Literature: summarize 3–5 key papers per target/cancer rather than exhaustive review

## 6) Recommended Focus

- Emphasize multi-dimensional scoring and cancer-type specific dependencies
- Prioritize expression correlation and mutation context for top-ranked cancers
- Build a concise narrative with 3–5 strongest indications; include risk notes on small sample sizes
