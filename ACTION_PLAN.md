### Action Plan

Generated: 2025-10-30

## 1) Immediate Next Steps (Oct 30 – Nov 3)

- Day 1 (Today – Oct 30)
  - Task 1: Finalize and save `synthetic_lethality_results.csv` figures (heatmap + table)
  - Task 2: Outline expression analysis notebook; define outputs (`expression_correlation.csv`, figure)
  - Expected outputs: `outputs/figures/synthetic_lethality_heatmap.png` (done), outline for 05_expression_correlation
- Day 2 (Oct 31)
  - Task 1: Implement expression-dependency correlation; save CSV + figure
  - Task 2: Integrate mutation context into rankings; produce `cancer_type_rankings_ENHANCED.csv`
- Day 3 (Nov 1)
  - Task 1: Light literature review for top 10 cancers/targets; extract 3–5 citations each
  - Task 2: Draft preliminary report sections (Intro, Methods, Results)
- Day 4 (Nov 2)
  - Task 1: Copy number impact (targets only); integrate into rankings
  - Task 2: Update figures and regenerate top-10 indication visuals
- Day 5 (Nov 3)
  - Task 1: Build 20-slide deck draft
  - Task 2: Compile comprehensive scoring table and export to CSV/PDF

## 2) Analyses to Complete

- Priority 1 (Must do)
  - [ ] Expression-dependency correlation — 8–10h — Output: `expression_correlation.csv`
  - [ ] Enhanced rankings integration — 4–6h — Output: `cancer_type_rankings_ENHANCED.csv`
  - [ ] Literature extraction — 8–12h — Output: `literature_summary.md`
  - [ ] Report draft — 12–16h — Output: `Preliminary_Report_Nov10.md` (PDF later)
  - [ ] Slide deck — 8–12h — Output: `Preliminary_Findings_Nov10.pptx`
- Priority 2 (Should do)
  - [ ] Copy number impact — 8–10h — Output: `copy_number_impact.csv`
  - [ ] Combination recommendations (rule-based) — 4–6h — Output: `combo_recs.md`
- Priority 3 (Nice to have)
  - [ ] Dashboard stub — 4–6h — Output: minimal static pages
  - [ ] Xata upload — 2–4h — Output: populated tables

## 3) Analyses to Skip/Defer

- [ ] Full literature mining automation — Defer (manual targeted search is sufficient for Nov 10)
- [ ] Advanced synergy modeling — Defer (requires more time/data)

## 4) Narrative Strategy

- Emphasize:
  - ✅ Dependency evidence with clear, reproducible rankings
  - ✅ Context-specific patterns (mutation/expression) driving vulnerability
- De-emphasize:
  - ⚠️ Broad essentiality claims (not supported)
  - ⚠️ Strong synthetic lethality magnitude (signals modest)
- Frame as: “Multi-dimensional profiling identified context-specific dependencies and prioritized rare and select common cancers for next validation.”

## 5) Communication Plan

- Update Dr. Taylor: Nov 1 (after expression results) with brief summary + 2 figures
- Stakeholder checkpoint: Nov 7 with draft report + slides
- Optional: Quick note today confirming plan and Nov 10 target remains feasible

## 6) Success Criteria (by Nov 10)

- [ ] Ranked top 5–10 cancer indications with multi-dimensional evidence
- [ ] Clear biomarker context (mutation/expression) per indication
- [ ] Preliminary report (PDF) and 20-slide presentation ready
